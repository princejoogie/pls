1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Digital asset trading is going to explode.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The digital asset trading future has the ability to completely disrupt trading.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
All assets in the future could be traded between individuals, between entities.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
At the moment, digital assets are largely being focused on currencies.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But I think going forward, there's lots of different ways in which digital assets can be monetized.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Once you accept that most assets around the world can be tokenized,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
you start seeing the adoption in everyday walk of life activities,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
you realize that there is something big happening here.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The digital asset space has really matured in the last 12 months,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and proof of that is a person like myself coming from the hedge fund industry,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
taking an interest in the space and thinking, how do we get involved?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The reason that institutions are not so involved in crypto trading at the moment

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
is the lack of transparency within the marketplace.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
They need to see processes and systems which either are regulated or act as if they are,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and are really, really robust on the technology, their custody,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and the way they perform, particularly with regard to compliance.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If the crypto market became regulated, institutional investors would flock towards it.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The size of the market is massive, and their clients feel that they need to get a share of this.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Archax is aiming to be a top-tier, regulated, institutional-focused digital asset exchange

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that differentiates itself from the current players

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
by being purely focused on institutions and their clients.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We want to be a respected, institutional-grade player that is headquartered in the City of London,

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and we want to build an exchange and have a custody solution that is institutional-grade and segregated,

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
where institutions and accredited investors feel comfortable buying and selling digital currencies.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Archax is a team of credible financial individuals

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
that have worked in a regulated environment their whole career.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The vision for Archax is to bring the traditional trading experience

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
into the digital asset, straight crypto world.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The key excitement at the moment is how digital asset trading is going to integrate

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
with the current financial infrastructure.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're dealing with tier-one software providers that have been providing matching engines

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
to the traditional financial markets for many years.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Our platform is going to be transparent, it's going to be delivered in an extremely regulatory, safe, secure way.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All of the participants on the exchange will have gone through anti-money laundering,

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and know your client checks.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Archax is very exciting because it's in one of the fastest moving industries in the world.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Anyone that you speak to starts being sceptical, they gradually get more excited,

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and before you know it they're fully engaged in the space and start to see the possibilities.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The future is massive. This will grow and grow and grow.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's an incredibly exciting space to be in.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We have the product, we have the people, we have the systems, we have the thinking,

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and we have the vision that we need to get there.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We've seen exchanges in the digital asset space pave the way for where we are today,

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and that's very important.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
For the institutions to come in, we need evolution.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Archax is the next stage of that evolution.
